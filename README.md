are added. Each assignment directory contains a <code>README.md</code> file
containing instructions for that particular assignment. If you browse the
repository via [GitHub](https://github.com/mepcotterell-cs1302/cs1302-spring-2014-hw),
then the Markdown (<code>.md</code>) files will be nicely formatted.

## Homework Assignments

Each assignment will contain at least two files: <code>README.md</code> and
<code>EXERCISES.md</code>. The <code>README.md</code> file contains the
instructions for that particular assignment. The <code>EXERCISES.md</code>
file contains starter Markdown text for the textbook excercises that are to be
completed. 

Additionaly, an assignment may contain an assortment of partially completed
<code>.java</code> files that are to be completed for the assignment. 
Instructions for these files are usually contained inside of the 
<code>.java</code> files as comments. The <code>README.md</code> file for
that assignment should indicate what <code>.java</code> files need to be
