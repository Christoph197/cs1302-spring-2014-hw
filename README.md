## Homework Assignments

<code>EXERCISES.md</code>. The <code>README.md</code> file contains the
instructions for that particular assignment. The <code>EXERCISES.md</code>
file contains starter Markdown text for the textbook excercises that are to be
completed. 

Additionaly, an assignment may contain an assortment of partially completed
<code>.java</code> files that are to be completed for the assignment. 
Instructions for these files are usually contained inside of the 
<code>.java</code> files as comments. The <code>README.md</code> file for
