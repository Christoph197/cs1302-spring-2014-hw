# README.md - Homework Assignment 1

This assignment is out of 20 points.

In the space provided for you in <code>EXERCISES.md</code>, please complete the
following exercises:

 * Lewis: pp. 28, EX 1.1 - 1.6
 * Lewis: pp. 68, EX 2.1, 2.4 and 2.6 - 2.8

Also, complete <code>GoDawgs.java</code> and <code>DistConverter.java</code>.

Since there was a problem notifying the book store about the Lewis text at the
beginning of this semester, I've included the actual exercise text in the
<code>EXERCISES.md</code> file for this assignment. Also, since this is the
first assignment, I've gone ahead and answered the first exercise so that
you can see how to respond with Markdown. If you would like to see what the
Markdown gets converted to, then visit <code>EXERCISES.md</code> file for
Homework 1 on [GitHub](https://github.com/mepcotterell-cs1302/cs1302-spring-2014-hw/blob/master/hw1/EXERCISES.md).

## Resources

Instructions for how to download Homework 1 to your 
<code>nike.cs.uga.edu</code> are included in the main repository
<code>README.md</code> file. It is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mepcotterell-cs1302/cs1302-spring-2014-hw/blob/master/README.md).

You should edit the files for this assignment directly (don't make copies of them)
using a plain text editor such as <code>emacs</code>, <code>vi</code>, or 
similar. Please be sure to include your name as well as the last three digits of
you 810 number within each of the files you submit.

## Submission Instructions

Please submit the following files:

 * Completed <code>EXERCISES.md</code> file. (10 points)
 * Completed <code>GoDawgs.java</code> file. (4 points)
 * Completed <code>DistConverter.java</code> file. (6 points)

Programs submitted for this assignment will only be graded if they
both compile and run on <code>nike.cs.uga.edu</code>. 

Assuming your repository is under <code>~/cs1302-spring-2014-hw</code>, you can
use the following commands to submit Homework 1:

```
$ cd ~/cs1302-spring-2014-hw
$ submit hw1 cs1302b
```

If you issued the commands correctly, then there should be a new
file in your <code>hw1</code> directory that is a timestamped
receipt of your submission. If we are unable to locate your submission,
then you'll need this receipt file in order resubmit your assignment
without any late penalty. 

It is also a good idea to email a copy of the assignment to yourself
after using the <code>submit</code> command (so that you have a
copy with the submission receipt in your records). To so this (assuming
your repository is under <code>~/cs1302-spring-2014-hw</code>), you can
simply execute the following commands:

```
$ cd ~/cs1302-spring-2014-hw
$ tar zcvf hw1.tar.gz hw1
$ mutt -s "[cs1302] hw1" -a hw1.tar.gz -- your@email.com < /dev/null
```

The steps above also create a <code>hw1.tar.gz</code> file in your
<code>cs1302-spring-2014-hw</code> directory. If you want, you
may delete this file. Take care not to accidentally delete your
<code>hw1</code> directory.
